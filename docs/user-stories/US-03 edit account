# US-03 edit account

As a user of the website, I want to be able to edit my account details so that I can make changes to them.

## Description

Create a "edit account" webpage.
After a user have logged into their account, they can enter the "edit account" page through a button.
In the "edit account" page, users see their username, password, email address, with a text input box beside each of them.
After the user updated their account information in the text box, he clicks the "save" button.
Then we update the data in the database.
After the update, we show the user a "success" message on the "edit account" page.
User can click "back" button to go back to his portfolio page.
