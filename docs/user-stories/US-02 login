# US-02 login

As a user of the website, I want to be able to log in and view my account details.

## Description

We prepare a login interface.
After registration, users can login with their account name and the password.
We query the database to check whether the password matches the account name.
If they match, then the user enters his portfolio page.
The portfolio pages includes the user's username and email address.
If they don't, an error is displayed on the login page.
