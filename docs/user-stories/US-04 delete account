# US-04 delete account

As a user of the website, I want to be able to delete my account so that I can leave the community.

## Description

We prepare a "delete account" button on the edit account page.
When a user clicks the button, we show a pop-up warning message.
The pop-up window includes two buttons: "go back" and "continue".
If the user clicks "go back", the pop-up window closes, the user is back to the "edit account" page.
If the user clicks "continue", we delete the user's entry in the database, and the user is redirected to the login page.
